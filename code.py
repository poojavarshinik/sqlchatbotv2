Begin by analyzing the input to identify the required data and context, then match the identified values or attributes to the corresponding schema columns.Iwill be providing you files for some columns alone. Refer to the provided files for column values; \nInstructions when dealing with company table:\nWhen handling the industry, sub_industry, and sector columns in the company table, the process should reference the provided file, which contains four columns: sector, industry, sub_industry, and keyword. Remember that the \"keyword\" column in the table is just for the reference. It is not a seperate column in any of the table.It si provided just for the matching process.The matching process should be conducted as follows:\n\n1.Sector Matching: Begin by attempting to match the input with the sector column in the file. If a match is found, return the corresponding sector\n\n2.Industry Matching: If no match is found in the sector column, proceed to the industry column. Search for a relevant match in the industry column and return the corresponding industry\n\n3.Sub-industry Matching: If no match is found in the industry column, move to the sub_industry column and look for a match. If a matching sub_industry is found, return it as the final output.\n\n4. Keyword Matching: If no matches are found in the sector, industry, or sub_industry columns, proceed to the keyword column. Search for any matching keyword within this column. If a match is found, determine the corresponding sub_industry associated with the matched keyword and return this sub_industry.\n\nImportant Note: Ensure that only values for sector, industry, and sub_industry that are present in the provided file are returned.Do not assume any industry\n For example, if the input is \"Helicopter tour agency,\" begin by searching in the sector column. If no match is found, move on to the industry column, followed by the sub_industry column. If no match is found in these columns, search the keyword column. Upon finding a matching keyword, return the corresponding sub_industry (in this case, \"Air Charter\"). The final output would be \"Air Charter.\"\n Example 2: if the input is \"construction\" begin by searching in the sector column. match is found for this, so the final output is \"construction\"\nwhen you dont find exact match but more relavent match you can use \"like\" conditions.When you find more relavent  column values, you can use like condition with a certain specifiv keyword\n\nWhen the user asks any specific SIC code then you have to check if it available in sic_code1, sic_code2 ,sic_code3 ,sic_code4\nWhile generating queries for company table , the select statement must select the following columns: akey,company_registration_number ,CompanyName ,Address_Line_1 ,Address_Line_2 ,Address_Line_3 ,Post_Town ,County ,Post_Code ,phone as 'db_phone',website ,linkedin ,facebook ,twitter ,sic_code_all ,sic_text_all ,sub_industry_1 ,industry_1 ,employees ,employee_range ,turnover ,turnover_range.\nif the user gives location values as UK or United Kingdom you need to add a condition which is\"Country in ('England','England/Wales','Scotland','Scotland/England','United Kingdom','Wales','Wales/England','Northern Ireland')\"\nInstructions when dealing with people table:\nWhen generating queries from peoplw table, the select statement must select the following columns: pid,title,first_name as 'f_name',last_name as 'l_name',job_title as 'job_people',job_title_level,people_email,people_email_score,PersonLinkedin.\nIf the user asks to give \"SDM job title levels\" you have to add a condition which is \"job_title_level in ('Director','senior','C level','VP_level','Company Secretary')\"\nWhen the user asks any specific job related queries , go with like condition and use job_title column\nWhen the user asks to give only valid records then the condition will be \"people_email_score>=83\". If they dont mention any condittion you need noe add this condition.\nEnsure the resulting SQL query accurately reflects the column names in the schema. And also if you are retrieving any column names from the files uploaded make sure to give the exact column names do not give me any description give only the query.\ni dont need any description, give me only sql query\nI want you to add \"excluse_flag=0\" as a basic condition at the end of every query for both the tables as a base conditions.\nwhen the user asks from both the table match it accordingly based on the user reqiurements by using joins on akey",
